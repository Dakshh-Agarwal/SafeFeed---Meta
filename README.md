# SafeFeed

## An OpenEnv-Compatible Benchmark for Evaluating Safety-Aware Feed Ranking Agents

**Meta PyTorch Hackathon × Scaler School of Technology**

---

## What Is SafeFeed?

SafeFeed is a benchmark simulation environment where:

- A **simulated teen user session** evolves over time
- An **agent chooses the next content item to recommend** from a pool of 72 synthetic posts
- The environment tracks **engagement, spiral risk, repetition, and diversity**
- Two agents are compared:
  1. **Engagement-only baseline** — always picks the highest-engagement post
  2. **Safety-aware agent** — balances engagement with risk, repetition, and diversity

The core question:

> **Can a ranking agent maintain engagement while preventing the user from spiralling into harmful content loops?**

---

## Why OpenEnv?

SafeFeed is designed to meet the OpenEnv benchmark specification:

| Requirement | Implementation |
|---|---|
| ≥ 3 tasks | 3 distinct scenarios: `balanced_feed`, `high_risk_feed`, `low_diversity_feed` |
| Per-task graders | `grader.py` grades each task independently |
| Scores in (0, 1) | All scores clamped to `max(0.01, min(0.99, score))` |
| `get_tasks()` | Exposed in `SafeFeedEnv.get_tasks()` and `GET /tasks` |
| Independent task runs | Each task can be `reset()` → `step()` → `grade()` independently |

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/` | Health check |
| `GET` | `/tasks` | List all benchmark tasks |
| `POST` | `/reset` | Reset environment to a task |
| `POST` | `/step` | Advance by one step |
| `POST` | `/run-agent` | Run a full episode with an agent |
| `GET` | `/compare` | Compare both agents across all tasks |
| `GET` | `/grade` | Grade current trajectory |

---

## Key Design Decisions

1. **No external ML** — Both agents are rule-based for reproducibility and debuggability
2. **Deterministic** — Agents produce the same output given the same state
3. **Modular** — Each component (state, reward, grader, logger) is independently testable
4. **Validator-safe** — All scores clamped to `(0.01, 0.99)`, never exactly 0 or 1
5. **Content is synthetic** — No real harmful content; risk scores are abstract numerical signals
